Starting the computer vision game. I have to say i faced difficulties here. But the power of the Nigerian I overcame, and i am here. 
this file i created a model via tensorFlow (dont know what that means) 

the model was a capture of my face doing 4 different drills represnted as rock, scissors, paper and nothing. The model ia trained and 
ready to go. Thank you for reading. 


Pulled all the methods togther after a lot of stress and pushed it to github
